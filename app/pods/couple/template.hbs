        <!-- <h4>About The Couple</h4> -->
        <p>Ali and Bryan met at Camp Tamarack where they spent a combined 26 summers as campers and staff. As the two most attractive individuals in camp, Ali and Bryan quickly recognized that they would be perfect for each other's competitive, fun, outgoing and often dangerous lifestyles. The two started dating during their 4th summer as staff. Six years later, Bryan successfully proposed to Ali, securing her to a 1-way contract with a no-trade clause, a two year team option and an undisclosed signing bonus to be in effect in August. Together, they make up one of the greatest chef-teacher combinations in the GTA since 2010. Ali and Bryan look forward to celebrating their upcoming wedding at Camp Tamarack with family and friends on August 27th, 2017.</p>
